1,Graduate,8/4/22 16:45,"Student: Notified that Crack the Coding Interview book is received, which I ordered for. How can I borrow it?
Librarian : Hi [name] :)
Librarian : Oh sure let me check the catalog about availability
Librarian : One sec
Librarian : I can't see it on my end yet, perhaps it has slightly different title
Librarian : Is it called Crack the Coding Interview
Student : But the problem is the book is always available at Noble library on the racks but not open for lending. I requested for the book which says is missing from Noble library.
Student : Cracking the coding interview : 189 programming questions and solutions is the name of the book
Librarian : OH yes I see it now, thanks :)
Librarian : [link]
Librarian : Looks like we have two copies, the stack copy is checked-out
Librarian : And we have a non-circulating reference copy.  In the library but it cannot be check out :(
Librarian : You can view the reference copy on the first floor of noble library
Librarian : [link]
Student : This is the same case when I made the request too. But I was told that they are ordering for that missing book
Librarian : Reference QA76.6 .M34 2015
Student : Is there any way I can boorw the book?
Student : *borrow
Librarian : If the book is missing, and ordered, then I'm sorry we'll have to wait for the replacement to come in
Librarian : The copy on the first floor
Librarian : Reference QA76.6 .M34 2015
Librarian : Can be viewed and read in the library
Librarian : But it cannot be checked out
Student : Okay. Is there any way that I can be notified when the book is replaced?
Librarian : reference books are non-circulating intentionally to give students and researchers opportunities to read the book
Student : ok
Librarian : If you click Request a Copy on the catalog record, the library should notify you once the book is avialable
Librarian : [link]
Librarian : If there are specific chapters of the book you need
Librarian : ON the same form
Librarian : You can click on Request Chapter Scan, and if we don't own the book, like in this case because it's missing
Librarian : And we are getting a replacement
Librarian : We can look for digital chapter copies for you from another library outside of ASU
Student : sure how can I get a digital copy?
Librarian : Oh sure, on the catalog record of the book
Librarian : [link]
Librarian : Click on Request Article or Chapter Scan
Librarian : Then follow the steps for requesting a specific chapter
Librarian : You wouldnt be able to request all of the chapters of the book because of copyright issues, but you can request a few chapters.  Roughly about 30 percent of a book
Librarian : Does that make sense?
Student : Yes
Librarian : Great! Hopefully you can get the research you need, and will get a replacement copy for you soon
Librarian : Good luck with your research [name]
Librarian : :)

Student : Got it. Thanks [name]. Also, this is my first time doing APA. IS there major difference in APA and MLA
Librarian : Oh, in terms of citation styles. There are some differences in the order of elements in citations when comparing APA (American Psychological Association) and MLA (Modern Language Association).
Librarian : See our ""Citation Styles"" library guide: [link]
Librarian : APA also has a free guide to the basics of their style: [link]
Librarian : Library One Search - and many of our individual research databases - also include ""Cite"" features which will generate citations according to APA, MLA, etc. We remind users that they are responsible for double-checking the accuracy of these auto-generated citations. But they can be a big time saver...

Does ASU has academic license for the Global Mapper software?

Student : No, I am a Ph.D. research assistant, and I need it for my research. I asked the Blue marbel, and they told me ASU has academic license.

Student : Fine.
Student : I will be graduating this December so I think I would have to buy it on my own
Librarian : If you want full access immediately, then yes, that would be your best option. Books are easy, we just buy them once. But subscriptions represent ongoing costs and our budget it tight. We have to cancel stuff we have to free up funds to buy new items. Once we buy them, they need to be accounted for in ongoing costs. So we have a fairly stringent process. Even free journals have to go through an abbreviated version.

This MUST be a peer-reviewed journal article or conference proceedings from the list below. Further, it must be an original research article (not a letter to the editor, commentary, or other type of paper).
Librarian : Hi [name]
Librarian : So you want me to confirm this is peer reviewed? (letters to the editor, etc. are not peer reviewed, even if published in a peer review journal). Let me check this title.
Librarian : OK, it's published in 

Applied Clinical Informatics
Librarian : I will check the status of this journal
Librarian : Yes, according to Ulrich's it is a peer reviewed journal.
Librarian : A Systematic Review (SR) in a peer reviewed journal would definitely be peer reviewed.
Librarian : I suspect is it NOT what your faculty would consider an ""Original research article"" however. All reviews, by their nature, are secondary research, not primary or original. Because rather than do research, they are going over and comparing the results of other people's research, making it a secondary analysis.
Librarian : I would check with your prof though. It's not entirely clear to me that they would object to a review article, based on the quoted section you provided.

By Ludwig Reimer
Librarian : Hi [name]. Let me check it
Student : thanks [name]
Librarian : It looks like we only have older editions. By any chance is this a textbook for your class?
Student : ahh older edition would work.... this book is related to my research and also class
Librarian : Here is a link to the 1997 edition. [Link]
Librarian : If it is not actually a textbook assigned to your class (which you are responsible to purchase yourself), but something you need for your research, you can request the most current edition through Interlibrary Loan.
Librarian : Our ILL dept will cancel requests for textbooks, but otherwise will get books for free if they can find it elsewhere.
Student : ahh ok.... do you think there's a pdf copy of this in our ASU library database?
Librarian : No. We clearly only have print.
Librarian : If you need only a couple of chapters, you can order those through ILL and get a digital copy within a day or so (typically). But not a whole book.
Librarian : If you need most or all of a book, a physical ILL has to be requested and it takes 1-3 weeks to arrive.
Student : hmm... ok i will request for the old version that's available at the Noble library then...
Student : thanks for all the help and information :)
Librarian : Good luck. If you need something, better to ask for it sooner rather than later.
Librarian : We don't charge for ILL so asking for a couple of key chapters now would be a good idea for you. You can ask for print and scanned chapters, we don't mind.
Student : ahh ok that's easier then... how owuld i process the request?
Librarian : Probably the easiest way for you is to go to the library main page: [Link]
Librarian : Across the top menu is ""Accounts""
Librarian : You want ""My ILL (ILLIAD) account""
Librarian : You may need to sign in with your ASURITE ID and password
Librarian : It will want some basic info - your status (undergrad, grad student etc.)
Librarian : And your preferred pick up location. That is for any future physical requests. It can be whatever ASU Library is most convenient for you.
Librarian : Then, it will have it's own menu. You will choose ""New Requests"" and either choose ""book"" for the physical book to be mailed or ""Book chapter"" to request 1-3 chapters be scanned and sent.
Librarian : You can do both, but each request needs to be done seperately.
Student : okay perfect!! thank you so much for such detailed description... i will request for it now
Librarian : Looks like the most current edition is 2008?
Librarian : Here is the table of contents, to help you pick which chapters to ask to be scanned: [Link]

2. I would like to develop my critical reading skills. I watched a video through the writing center at ASU and it showed a writing log where you could write down notes while activley reading anything.  It has questions like ""What is the thesis? What is the main idea in each paragraph?"" I would like to develop better reading strategies to help me with researching, reading, and writing.

Note: I did look on the ASU web site but was overwhelmed with all the info and figured I could as a librarian to help expedite the process.

How do I cite a source within a source?

I'm reading a passage in a book written by Jon Doe, who cites (has a citation) to an author from another book. I would like to use the citation. How do I do that?

For example, if you read a work by Lyon et al.

I hoping I can use to learn search algorithms better to do this. As an example, I have a hypothesis which suggest that the rise in garish graphic design is related to a rise in narcissism and people wanting to stand out on social media. So, how could I do a search that might get me some evidence to back this up?

Librarian : what databases have you used so far?

Librarian :  

Academic Search Premier is a good place to start, it has everything, and covers many disciplines. I start there before I use OneSearch
Student : I'm finding that research is both an art and a science, and I'm still learning how to find the info I need.
Librarian : So true. so start with a few search terms. when you find a good article, take note of the official subject terms used for that article, then go back and re-do your search with those terms
Student : Ok. That helps. I have not tried that approach.
Librarian : by using the ""official subject terms"" listed in the article info, you can find similar articles
Student : Will those terms be listed somewhere?
Librarian : yes, when you click on the article title, those are listed
Student : Ok. I'll look for them.
Librarian : in Academic Search, I tried the terms social media on the top line and graphic design on the second line, [Link]
Student : Would I put social media in quotes?
Librarian : not at the beginning, but you might later
Student : I mean, when you have two terms, if you just want those together, you would put them in quotes?
Librarian : if you use quotes, the words have to be next to each other, yes
Student : Ok.
Librarian : try without the quotes first, then narrow down with quotes if you get too many hits
Student : I'm looking at the Boolean search terms too. I just noticed that.
Librarian : and see what other terms may be used
Student : Okay.
Librarian : right, AND combines, and using OR gives you everything with those terms, even if only one term appears

Librarian : Welcome to ASU Library Ask-A-Librarian chat service. I'm reviewing your question and will respond shortly.
Librarian : Hi [name]! Just to clarify, you would like to know if IJEE is available via one of those databases?
Student : Yes, but I'd like to know if IJEE is available in all of those databases
Librarian : Ok. One moment while I check the library website.
Librarian : So, according to our website, we can only provide access to that journal through ""Free E-Journals"" and only 1992-2002. Here is the link to the record. [Link]
Librarian : You may be able to find particular articles published in that journal through Google Scholar and it may be that articles from that journal could be available in one of those other databases but our subscriptions to those databases do not provide access to that journal.
Librarian : Do you have any further questions at this time?
Student : What do you mean by ""our subscriptions to those databases do not provide access to that journal."" ?
Student : can i access IJEE articles from those databases?
Librarian : In order to access articles from that journal for free, ASU Library only provides it through the Free E-Journals database. I did a search in our system for that journal title and the only database that it is showing me is the Free E-Journals. See the link above for details.
Librarian : In short, no, I'm not finding that you can access that journal through those other databases.
Student : Ok, thank you
Student : another question
Student : can you clarify for me something? When you say that a database has ""indexed"" a journal, does that mean that that database can access that journal's articles?
Librarian : That is correct.
Student : ok, thank you for your help
Student : I'll log off now

Librarian : It includes a section on copyright
Librarian : [Link]
Student : so
Librarian : Here's the paragraph on copyright to my thesis/dissertation?Copyright registration is not required, since copyright is automatic 
and comes into effect at the moment original work is fixed in a tangible
 medium. But registration has certain advantages.  First, if your work 
is registered you have proof that you are the author of the work and the
 owner of its copyright. Also, registration is necessary to enforce a 
copyright against an infringer or plagiarist. If you want to register 
copyright of your thesis/dissertation, you can do it online directly 
through the Copyright Office website at [Link] or through ProQuest, who will register the copyright for you.
Student : So, suppose I want to publish my chapters as journal papers
Student : then do I need to apply for copyright registration?
Librarian : If you need to copyright to prove you are the owner of the work for future endeavors, then you may want to consider registering with the Copyright Office... Proquest can on your behalf, I don't know if there is a cost though
Librarian : Keep in mind once the dissertation is published, the copyright is automatic, registering adds a layer if you believe in the future it would be necessary to enforce a 
copyright against an infringer or plagiarist.

You can also access Statista off-campus. Here is how.

If you have questions regarding our content or technical issues, please get in touch with a library staff member.

Sincerely,
Your Statista Team
Student : I Entered my email into :
Know if your university has access to statista.
On entering my ASU email, I received a confirmation from them.
Student : No, I did not try to start an individual access.
Librarian : ok, we do not have access to Statista, but it is something that we have had many requests for, and I hope that we eventually get that database
Student : So is there a way I can access to the statistas database
Librarian : but that email is incorrect. we do not subscribe to Statista, sorry! Here are the statistical databases we do have access to, [Link]
Librarian : not through ASU
Student : If i wish to get the access can ASU help me fund it, Since its for my internship and research purpose.
Librarian : not through the library, but you might want to see if there are funds in your department
Librarian : the library does not have funds for individuals, all of our subscriptions are institutional access
Student : OKay [name]
Librarian : sorry! I wish we had it as well!
Student : Can you please guide me with anyother such website which has global data and which I can access for free or a better prize. 
since statista is $860 a month

If you believe an item charged to your account has been returned, please fill out the [Link].

Student : Okay. Please let me explain further.
Student : I renewed the book that I borrowed online and it was due next year May 2024
Librarian : ok
Student : Then I went to Atlanta, GA for a month.
Student : In that month they recalled the book and I was not in town so I was not able to return the book on time.

Student : I returned the book on the day I returned which was June 15. I also asked the librarian over there at the information desk where should I reach out.
Student : He gave me an email address I emailed them about this situation but they said that was the insurance department. So, I was given a wrong email address.
Librarian : Recalls are a special case. Once a fine has been levied, it is tough to remove it. Th epolicy states 
Items not returned by midnight on the recall due date are billed a daily $5.00 per item fee; up to a maximum of $25.00.
		Recall late fees are strictly enforced and only the replacement cost is cancelled when the item is returned.

Librarian : Hello.Is this for freshman composition (100-level English course)?
Student : Yes this is, I am currently a freshman.
Librarian : okay. thank you.
Librarian : Well, how ""success"" is defined is clearly going to be a factor. Are you going to focus on professional success (employment), and if yes, how much importance do you place on salary / wages, etc.
Librarian : Success can be defined as attainment of goals and objectives. What are the goals or objectives?
Student : Well, I am mainly focusing on how some people have well-paid jobs even though they only graduated from high school. And yes, I place salary to be very important as I'm planning on using company owners as an example.

For instance, if your impact was reducing unemployment among individuals with special needs, you could locate an ebook exploring public employment policies, or a journal article analyzing the current rates of employment among individuals with special needs, or really anything related to unemployment or special needs as long as it's an online resource through the ASU libraries.

The deliverable for this assignment will be a screenshot of the resource on the ASU library website.  You won't need to do anything with the resource; just locating the resource and submitting proof that you found it is enough for full credit on this assignment.
Librarian : OK, so my advice based on the prompt is to go to lib.asu.edu

Librarian : When you get a list of results, you can scroll until you see something you like to get your screenshot, If there is nothing you like, my recommendation is to adjust your keywords.
Librarian : Once you have run a search, you can also use the filters on the right to limit your results, by date, or by format. Whatever works for you.

Librarian : Can you share your topic?

Librarian : Hello [name]
Student : Hello!
Librarian : It is often best to start with natural language terms rather than subject headings.
Librarian : For example, try Animal Testing in one search box and Comestic Industr in the other box.
Librarian : I am going to try that search in library one search to see what book search results will be.  One minute...
Student : okay! thank you!!
Librarian : Also, for both one search and our databases, remember to use the advanced search.  It provides more options.

Human Use of Animals Case Studies in Ethical Choice

267,Undergraduate,1/25/23 10:06,"Student: This was my citation for a source I had found on google scholar for my  English 102 class essay.Leigh, Anderson, and Donald R Glover. “Building Character, Community, and a Growth Mindset
in Physical Education.” Human Kinetics, Google Books, 2017, https://books.google.com/books?id=-PF6DwAAQBAJ&;lpg=PR1&;ots=pyL1sLjW5b&;dq=Human%2Band%2Bemotional%2Bgrowth%2C%2Bmindset%2Bgrowth%2C%2Bhuman%2Bdevelopment%2C%2Bgrow%2Bas%2Ba%2Bperson&;lr&;pg=PR1#v=onepage&;q=Human%20and%20emotional%20growth,%20mindset%20growth,%20human%20development,%20grow%20as%20a%20person&;f=false   
I was told I need to get a permalink for the source in order for it to be counted as valid. Could you find me a permalink for this source?
Librarian : Hello [name]!
Student : hello!
Librarian : did you just want me to confirm the citation for you?
Student : No I needed a permalink for the source
Librarian : oh ok, I see now, it didn'tt see it afgter the long link, hahaha
Student : All good haha I just realized
Librarian : one sec
Student : sure thing take your time
Librarian : ok, sorry it's take so long, but I've been trying to see if there are any other ways to access the book, and I'm not spotting any
Librarian : so it looks to me like you have grabbed the proper permalink for google books, its just because google formats thing differently its still super long
Librarian : you could in theory use the link for the full book instead of the chapter and that would be shorter, but if you are referencing only the chapter then you have the one you need
Librarian : [Link]
Librarian : as long as you are clicking the ""link"" button in google books you have gotten the correct link
Student : okay thank you let me check with my teacher real quick.
Librarian : they're probably just confused because it is so long, usually permalinks are shorter, but this time that's the way its supposed to look
Student : ah yeah
Student : I was thinking that's the case too
Student : but otherwise I fail the essay if I don't have this shorter link ??
Librarian : Oh no! then your best option is probably swapping over to the link for the full book as opposed to the chapter ??
Librarian : this is for APA format, right?
Student : MLA format
Student : would it matter if the only chapter I'm citing is the one appearing on google books?
Librarian : hang on, let me double MLA, I'm more familair with APA
Librarian : so here is the conundrum. if you're citing it as an e-book then you don't even need a permalink... [Link]
Librarian : however if you're citing it as a website you would have to...
Student : ahhh
Student : hmmm
Librarian : honestly I would just try to get i contact with your instructor and ask how they would like you to format it
Student : okay
Librarian : a lot of times they have their own specific changes to standard format that they /think/ is the norm but is technically speaking wrong
Librarian : or maybe they just don't understand this particular situation, because a lot of time formatting is kinda squishy
Student : righttttt
Student : my teacher isn't responding
Student : but I am recording the important bits of this conversation
Student : what is the difference between a normal URL and a permalink
Student : I was trying to find online
Student : and there wasn't a real clear answer
Librarian : the URL is just the link at the top of the website and will typically expire in a day or two. the permalink will continue working long term
Student : ahhh
Librarian : it's more used inside the library databases since you have to log in with a password to access it initially, so part of the url includes your session log in with will immediately expire once you close the webpage
Student : I know its kind of a weird question but how does a URL expire?
Student : Oh i see
Librarian : in other cases on the open web google may just update the links, so its possible, but not as frequently an issue on the open web
Student : okay interesting
Student : could I buy the book somehow and try and cite that way?
Student : because the book is embedded in the google book format
Student : but if I could take it out
Student : would that change anything
Librarian : I suppose if you bought it then you would just format it as a ebook and the permalink wouldn't be necessary... but you're already technically citing it properly, so you shouldn't have to
Student : okay
Student : all very frustrating
Librarian : yes, I completely understand. Citations are really annoying
Student : LOL
Student : if you don't mind me asking why did you become a librarian?
Student : My teacher mentioned something about needing a PhD in library sciences
Librarian : I'm not technically I librarian yet, I'm still working on my masters in library science, but soon! I enjoy helping connect people to the information their looking for
Librarian : thankfully we don't need a PHD only masters
Librarian : but as we discovered tonight, sometimes the information is very murky and difficult to navigate due to other constraints
Student : Oh that's so cool
Student : I can see how that would be rewarding
Student : yes very murky haha
Student : I wish I knew this would be an issue but you live and learn
Librarian : yeah, again, I'm so sorry, you just happened to land in a less than preferable situation
Librarian : does the assignment need to be submitted tonight?
Student : it's okay
Student : no it's already been submitted and graded but she's giving me a chance to find a permalink
Student : i have a 60/100 currently but I think shes willing to work with me through this process
Librarian : Oh boy, that does complicate things. but from what your telling me it seems like if she's willing to work with you on it, she should be fine holding off until tomorrow if you do shoot her an email explaining the situation
Librarian : but of course, that's just my impression
Student : right
Student : this is day 2 of the discrepancy so I don't think there's a deadline for a resolution
Student : just sooner than later
Librarian : of course. well I do with you the best of luck in it. And Purdue OWL website is the definitive guide for citations outside of the MLA manual itself, and it show that what you're doing is the proper way to format it since google books isn't /technically/ and ebook and should probably be cited as a webpage [Link]

Librarian : Either way is fine with me.
Student : This is the assignment.As next-gen artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT rapidly advance, educational institutions like [name]ona State University are early testing grounds for the practical applications and ethics of consumer-focused AI. Some advocates claim its educational value and potential are too great to ignore, while critics argue its potential value is not worth the risk, as the tool incentivizes behavior at odds with basic knowledge-building principles.

Today, since ASU positions itself as a global leader in innovation, the stakes behind how to handle the technology are high. The university’s Innovation Board–a select group of ASU professors and administrators across departments who evaluate innovative ideas, gauge their risks and rewards, and determine if those ideas align with ASU’s mission statement, educational principles, and academic ethos overall–is trying to decide if ChatGPT is the type of technology they want to leverage in the classroom and associate the university with in general. If successful, ASU would reaffirm its position as a leader in innovation in the global spotlight. If ASU fails, however, the consequences would be disastrous. In an effort to get a fresh perspective on the matter, the Innovation Board is randomly selecting a group of students to weigh in on the decision-making process. You are one of those students. They want to know what ASU should or should not do, and why.

Regardless of their decision, ASU acknowledges a portion of students will abuse ChatGPT to complete their assignments no matter what. Therefore, in addition to helping the Innovation Board with the above, they have tasked you with creating an evaluation system that helps staff and students differentiate between original content and content potentially generated by AI. The Board wants you to use your system to evaluate three short essays to strengthen and add credibility to your proof of concept.


GETTING STARTED:

This assignment comes in two parts. Both parts make up your written essay.

The Proposal. You must read about and research recent conversations regarding the use of ChatGPT in an educational context. You are required to research and understand all relevant perspectives and their dominant arguments/supporting reasons on the topic. You must also determine what ASU’s mission statement, educational principles, and academic ethos are or represent. Based on all of this information, write a proposal that explains why ASU should or should n

316,Undergraduate,4/4/23 10:42,"Student: I just completed an undergrad course on QM and I'm now doing a summer research project with the professor and we settled on the initial research topic as how quantum tunneling effects semiconductor devices, but I'm having some trouble figuring out what specifically to focus on.  We're planning on doing simulations in Python and the professor found this library: https://docs.solcore.solar/en/master/Solvers/DeviceStructure.html, which looks promising, particularly the page on creating different device structures.  
The professor had suggested looking into how defects, particularly hanging bonds, effects the probability of tunneling and how that, in turn, effects the device performance.  That sounds like it might be interesting, but I don't know enough about it to say if it's even a large enough effect to be relevant, and the articles I'm finding on the topic are a bit over my head.  

Basically, I need help figuring out how to come up with a specific research question that I have suffici
Librarian : Hi [name]... I hope you are well. I am reviewing your question. 
Student : Cool, thanks
Student : I realize you probably aren't familiar with the physics topics and that's OK.  I can do the reading myself to learn about them.  I just need help narrowing down my research question and finding good information.
Librarian : [name], have you looked at the references to the articles that are "" above your head? 
Librarian : Also, can you give a citation or two for the materials that were on target but too detailed? 
Librarian : What key words did you use in your search
Librarian : sorry for all of the questions.  I can try to help you now but will definitely refer you to our STEM librarians. 
Student : I was looking at this wiki article just as a starting point: [Link]
Student : but it doesn't really explain the equations in enough detail that I could see how to actually apply them.  There are lots of references listed, so many I don't even know where to start
Librarian : OK, let me see if I can identify an online encyclopedia for physics that we might have. 
Student : I also found this article: [Link], which is way more detailed, but it uses terminology I'm unfamilar with.
Student : ok thanks
Librarian : Here is an online encyclopedia for mathematical physics... maybe that has something. Can you check it while I keep looking?   Franc?oise, J. P., et al. Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics. 1st ed., Elsevier, 2006. [Link]

Student : Looks the second one might be
Student : Thanks
Librarian : So, what I am doing is looking at the citations to the article you shared. I think that is a good strategy because they usually talk about the literature upon which their research is built.. the author's literature review with situates their research in existing research if that makes sense. 
Librarian : I would also look at article that cite the one you found. To do that, go to Google Scholar and type in the title of the article in quotations... see who has cited it since it was published... 
Student : OK, thanks
Librarian : I think our STEM librarians will be able to take this further. This gives you a strategy for now.... 
Student : Yes, thanks for your assistance.
Librarian : 1. Look at physics encyclopedias   go to the library website   [Link]  to use the Search box there. I typed physics encyclopedias   THEN, I limited the results to fulltext online... you will see that in the menu of filters on the right side. 
Librarian : 2. Review the citations of articles you find on topic but too detailed to see if something more general is cited. 
Librarian : 3. Use Google Scholar... from the library HOme page.. frequently used resources menu to find the articles you liked. Then check the CITED items to see if there is something of use.
